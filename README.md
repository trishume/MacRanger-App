# MacRanger

MacRanger is a fork of iTerm2 that basically acts as a separate application for using [ranger](http://ranger.nongnu.org/) as your main file manager.

At the moment it just uses a different name and icon, but I plan on adding some special features.

This is meant to go with [my ranger dotfiles](https://github.com/trishume/dotfiles/tree/master/ranger/ranger.config) which add iterm2 inline images and patched font based icons.

## Coming Soon

- Dragging things onto dock icon to cd there.
- A little window that allows you to drag files into other apps using normal OSX drag-n-drop.
- Quicklook
